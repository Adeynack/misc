- description: >-
    Normal string on the same line. Without quotes in the content, there is no
    need to quote it.
  example: This is a string that needs no quotes nor escaped character.

- description: >-
    Normal string on the same line. With un-escaped quotes within the content,
    there is no need to quote the entire value.
  example: This is a string with "unescaped double-quotes" that do not need to be entiredly quoted nor escaped.

- description: >-
    Normal string on the same line, but with escaped characters (double quotes),
    forcing it to be quoted.
  example: "This is a string that needs some \"escaping\" since it contains double quotes."

- description: >-
    Normal string on the same line, but with escaped characters (line feeds),
    forcing it to be quoted.
  example: "This is a string that needs some escaping since it\ncontains line feeds."

- description: >-
    Multi-line string where all line feeds are replaced by escaped-n, containing
    a final line feed.
  example: |
    This is on
    multiple lines
    and contains
    a final line feed.
  result: "This is expressed on\nmultiple lines\nand does not contains a final line feed.\n"

- description: >-
    Multi-line string where all line feeds are replaced by escaped-n, not ending
    with a final line feed.
  example: |-
    This is on
    multiple lines
    and does not contain
    a final line feed.
  result: "This is expressed on\nmultiple lines\nand does not contains a final line feed."

- description: >-
    Continuous string, expressed on a multiple lines. Every line feed is
    replaced by a space and it contains a final line feed.
  example: >
    This is expressed on
    multiple lines but yields
    a continuous string.
    It contains
    a final line feed.
  result: "This is expressed on multiple lines but yields a continuous string. It contains a final line feed.\n"
  
- description: >-
    Continuous string, expressed on a multiple lines. Every line feed is
    replaced by a space and it does not end with a final line feed.
  example: >-
    This is expressed on
    multiple lines but yields
    a continuous string.
    It does not contain
    a final line feed.
  result: "This is expressed on multiple lines but yields a continuous string. It does not contain a final line feed."

- description: >-
    Continuous string, double-quoted, expressed on multiple lines with escaped
    line feeds. Every line feed is removed (no space inserted) and it does not
    end with a final line feed.
  example: "This is expres\
    sed on multiple lines \
    but yields a continuous string. It does not contain a final line feed"
  result: "This is expressed on multiple lines but yields a continuous string. It does not contain a final line feed."
